# The Odin Project: Landing Page
This is a mockup of a basic landing page usinc css and html.
It is a project from "The Odin Project". Specifically: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page

## Requirements and Constraints
The project provides two separate images. These have been categorized into two separate categories for requirements ([content](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png) and [specific](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/02.png)):

## Reflection Part 1 (Different Approach Taken)
This project was done extremely quickly, as from previous experience - the developer @yjchess has done some reflection on other projects and work and has decided to change his approach to TOP. Instead of meticulously going through every lesson and rabbit hole, he has decided to take a faster approach to skim-through and attempt to go through the course quickly. The reasoning behind this is that @yjchess would like to find the balance needed in order to maximize productivity whilst maintaining and keeping useful knowledge.

He has unfortunately, suffered from burnout from taking cybersecurity courses, programming courses, meetings to improve general life skills and employability skills and other responsibilities. Henceforth, he has decided on a new approach towards his studies; first he will begin with experimentation to see the best pace to go through study materials, then he will re-iterate over his study plans. He has decided to try and optimize efficiency by experimenting with more atypical choices to try and work with his ADHD. Hence, the quality of his projects may drop briefly and seem more unprofessional at first (for example this project was done with only a single commit). However; this may lead to a more knowledgeable and experienced developer in the long run.

This will be a hard journey as @yjchess struggles with perfectionism and OCD. Although these sound like they will be beneficial; they do in fact contribute to lower overall efficiency.

## Reflection Part 2 (Project)
- Content Requirements met (about 90 percent similar to image provided)
- Specific Requirements met

## Reflection Part 3 (Improvements and questions)
I won't talk about improvements to the content of the project as that is a mute point; since the main objective of the project was to get a website up that looks aesthetically pleasing and vaguely matches the images provided. Both of these requirements have been met.

However; I did waste time messing with margins etc to get the project more in line with how the images looked. A little bit of this is fine - but make sure I don't go overboard. Also I have spent an awful lot of time writing this readme - which may be seen as wasteful time.

What I will say about the project however - are some questions reflecting my code that I was not sure about. I won't spend too much time on researching the answers as this is not important right now but may become important later:

- Did I use bad naming conventions for my custom variables? Also should I have variables with the same value but different names for clarity sake? Or is this bad as it doesn't follow: DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
- Was the idea of using sections the right approach to split up the page?
- I did not have a header tag. Perhaps I should have used one instead of the section tag.
- If I did use a header tag, should the hero and nav sections both go inside?
- My main element was a child of a section tag; is this bad practice?
- Links don't change color when hovered over - need to improve for better UX.
- I copied the copyright from the image. This should hopefully be ok since the aim of the project was to imitate the image; and the copyright comes from the organization creating these porjects.
- Should I use i tag instead of making it italic in the css?

Probably a lot more that could be improved; but focussing on speed now - so I will say that I am done for now. Although one last thing: Could've just linked the images and not written out a lengthy requirements.
